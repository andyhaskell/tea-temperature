# tea-temperature

This is the app we built on my Go [ClimaCell client tutorial]() series, in which we build and use a Go client for the hourly forecast endpoint of the [ClimaCell API](https://www.climacell.co/weather-api/docs/) so the sloths of the Cambridge Fresh Pond know whether to make hot or iced hibiscus tea at 5PM, based on the weather.

The client we build in the tutorial is similar to the one I have a full GitHub repo for at [github.com/andyhaskell/climacell-go](github.com/andyhaskell/climacell-go), which is looking for contributions.
